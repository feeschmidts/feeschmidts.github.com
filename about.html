        <h2 class="hello">Hello!</h2>
        <div class="span12">
            <p class="statement about">I like to design fun and meaningful new services and tools which allow people to collaborate, learn and create. Most of my work is user centred with a focus on cocreation mainly in social or environmental projects. I would like to gain more experience designing web and native apps in a closely knit team made up of developers and other designers which would ideally also provide an opportunity to deepen my frontend skills with the intention of being able to create interactive prototypes for testing and gaining more insight into UI. I like to get stuck into projects and try to work transparently in an agile manner for better teamwork and progress.
