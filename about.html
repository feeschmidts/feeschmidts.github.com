For this project I curated, designed and built a responsive website which allowed visitors to emerge in stories and inspirations of patterns of fabrics and textures. For this I interviewed and followed the makers of the piece, MA textile students at Chelsea Collage of Art and the makers at Pirate Technics. The website is a mashup of soundcloud, youtube, flickr, staticloud and github <a href="baobab.html"> more <span aria-hidden="true" class="icon-arrow-right"></a></p>
