		<h2 class="project__titles span8of8">Monchique Novas Direcoes</h2>
		<p>A three months Leonardo Da Vinci program to learn about sustainable tourism in Monchique, South Portugal. Collaborating with the council, residents and local businesses a small group of four responded to local opportunities and developed ideas to promote Monchique as an up and coming destination.</p>
		<p>Monchique is situated at the foot of the tallest point of the Algarve, called Foia, amidst rolling hills and beautiful nature. It's the home to many German and English expats, alternative communities and sustainable minded guest houses who cultivate permaculture gardens, offering a low-tech lifestyle or just a place to relax. Annually three million tourists travel through Monchique to enjoy the view of the tallest point, leaving ten minutes later with local businesses in town missing out on the masses. There is more to Monchique than Fioa! and even the tourism office in town encourages tourists to leave and visit other places of the Algarve than Monchique.</p>
		<p>To address this five maps were created together with the council and local businesses which are easily downloadable and printed, by guest houses or tourists. They suggest itenaries for walks and opportunities to visit local craft makers. These maps together with ideas on how to create a 'Monchique Brand' were showcased in a week-long exhibition called 'Monchique Novas Direcoes' (Monchique New Directions) with the intent to gain local's feedback, invite press and get Monchique noticed!</p>

		<h1 class="project__titles">My Role</h1>
		<p>My main focus were the <a href="monchique-maps.html">Veredas de Monchique Maps</a>. I researched, GPS traced and collected their information, worked closely with Janki on the illustrations and with Julia on the copy. For the Novas Direcoes Exhibition I planned and curated the exhibition layout and panels, took photos and documented the exhibition on a seperate <a href="http://novasdireceos.wordpress.com">Novas Direcoes blog</a> and responded to comments and invited locals.</p>

		<h3>What makes Monchique unique?</h3>
		<p>To understand Monchique's strengths and opportunities we needed sample Monchique's best and benchmark it's neighbouring villages. I went on a road trip to visit <a href="http://relvinhas.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/salir_alte_tourism_office.pdf">Salir's, Alte's & Silves' tourism offices</a> and assess their nature and <a href="http://relvinhas.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/salir_alte_leaflet.pdf">village walks</a> and their <a href="http://relvinhas.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/rocha-a-pena_leaflet.pdf">information</a> they provided for guidance.</p>
		<blockquote>Monchique's tourism office is run by the Algarve Tourism Board, providing very few information about Monchique itself.</blockquote>

		<h3>Researching local crafts</h3>
		<p>Monchique has a union of local Medronho producers (Medronho is the local fire water made from Medronho berries). Most craft makers are independent, retailing through some of the craft shops, which often are family businesses. Monchique counts chair making, ceramics, honey, wooden spoons, cork products and sausage to their local produce.</p>

		<h3>Blogging &amp; Documenting</h3>
		<p>I captured ideas and impression of everything we did during those months in Monchique on my <a href="http://relvinhas.wordpress.com">Relvinhas Blog</a>. My favourites are <a href="http://relvinhas.wordpress.com/2011/10/19/a-dry-stone-wall/">learning how to build a dry stone wall</a> researching the tile making process of <a href="http://relvinhas.wordpress.com/2011/11/04/aluzejas/">'Alujezos de Portugal'</a> and evaluating the <a href="http://relvinhas.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/medronho_season/">seasonal Medronho experience</a>.</p>
		<p>For the <a href="http://novasdirecoes.wordpress.com">exhibition Novas Direcoes</a> I set up a separate blog to capture the exhibition's content to refer press and visitors to.</p>

		<h3>Internal Workshops</h3>
		<p>The purpose of the Leonardo Da Vinci program was differently communicated to its participants, collaborators and the village. For the participants the objective was as broad as 'self development' and learning something about sustainable tourism by working with local businesses. As far as the partnering businesses were concerned, they gained free labour but did not see the advantages of having access to such an interdisciplinary group with such a brought skill set. It required management and sharing each others visions and planning ahead, ensuring everyone (participant and businesses) were doing something they enjoyed and would be beneficial long term.</p>
		<p>Together with Julia I interviewed everyone, summarising their intent and what they wanted to get out of it. We ran two workshops sharing these insights with one another and planning together next steps, trying to assist the local coordinator who's job this would have been. Details on this learning of group management can be read on the <a href="http://relvinhas.wordpress.com/2012/01/03/project_reflection/">relvinhas blog.</a></p>

		<h1>We're in the news!</h1>
		<p>The project was covered twice in regional newspapers 'Algarve 123' and 'Algarve News'. The later caused quite a few comments and praise, the first - the reporter was more interested in the controversy of the project spending EU funds on such a project rather than trying to highlight its positives.</p>

		<blockquote>"I think it's always a pity when there is not enough money to do the proper interview research (among potential investors and among potential visitors), together with the think-tank approach you maintained. But that's life, isn't it?! Anyway, if ever you are thinking of doing such a project somewhere else, don't forget to think of Sagres!"<p class="small">Han from Sagres</p></blockquote>
