	<p>The SnackStopper app is a Windows 8 native app which helps you to snack less and feel good. It helps you to resist the extra coffee or biscuit and encourages the sharing of your successes. The more you resist the more Feel Good Points you collect which you can boost by donating to charity to feel even better!</p>

		<h1>Step by step user journey</h1>
		<p class="small">1. A serious snacker downloads the SnackStopper app from marketplace
		2. User opens the app and reads the 1.2.3. section titles. '1. Everytime you resist a snack drag it into the heart'. It comes pre-populated with 12 unhealthy food and drink items.
		3. User can customise tiles with things they want to consume less off. (needs communication)
		4. User can close the app as there is no additional setup required at this point.
		5. The live tile shows a 0 reminding people that they haven't resisted a snack yet.
		6. First time the person denies a snack, he/she opens the snack app and drags the item he did not have into the heart. The heart fills up, pumping energy through its veins.
		7. In the FeelGood section, numbers go up by 1 and person get's praise. He/She is encouraged to share his new status with other colleages and friends via the Charms bar. (Needs stronger communication)

			<p class="small">8. He/She feels good and is looking out for more opportunities to record instances on the app.
		9.Overtime the Feel Good Points go up, on good days with lots of occasions of saying 'No' people are encouraged to boost their feel good points by donating to charity and boasting about it to their friends.
		10. He/She decides to boost points and goes to See the Difference Website. He/She sets up a profile and login and selects a charity which she donates GBP 5 to. This time it's to save bare bottom monkeys in Guatamala.
		11. Upon completion of the payment, He/She returns to the SnackApp to check whether her/his daily feel good points have been added.
		12. They have! Great, now He/She has a total of 43 points over a duration of 5 weeks. That's pretty good going. Charly who's also using the app, for sure has only achieved 20. 'Let's tease him'. He/She goes over to Charms and selects Charly from the frequent sharing options. The text reads: 'Sofie has resisted xxx and just boosted her points to 43 Feel Good Points. Can you beat it?'</p>
