		- name: Simple Scss Framework
			img: An arrangement of pages
			description: A lightweight framework that can be used for the xively platform as well as customer apps by simply applying a different theme. Both twitter bootstrap and foundation require a lot of overwriting of styles if you want to stray from its defaults. With more front end resource in house we decided to write our own framework, that we would know inside out and apply a ‘styleguide first’ principle to ensure ux and visual consistency throughout. As Xively works with many contractors, it became the go to place to download latest logos, brand guidelines or familiarise themselves with ux patterns or copy guidelines.
			role: Overseeing and coordinating the development of the framework, contributing modules and writing a large proportion of the documentation.
			achievements:
				- reducing the front-end size from XXX to 82 bites which equates to the same size as typekit.
				- large sections of the framework were adopted by other logmein products
				- it significantly improved the speed of end-user app development from a front end perspective

			details:
				- Folder structure
				- responsive grid behaviour
				- layouts
				- extends
