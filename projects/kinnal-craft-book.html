			How often does one look at digital photo albums? I have been meaning to design this coffee table book for many years to properly summarise the crafts process, make use of the many artful photographs and to accompany the DVD and online video content I created just after the project's completion.

			With its fifth year anniversary coming up, some of the group members will be returning to the village of Kinnal to meet our old friends and work alongside them once more doing Kinnal. A bunch of books are already packed awaiting for their long journey.

		<h1 class="project__titles span8of8">My role</h1>
		<p>Along side with participating in the Kinnal Craft project, I collected and archived all photos, stories and media articles from the trip. With improved layout and better English skills I amended the voice over scripts as text for the book, Ailsa proof read and co-wrote sections. I planned the structure of the book and prepared all illustrations and visual imagery. As this was a self initiated project I also prepared the file for print, ordered a proof reading copy and created new editions.</p>

		<h3>Printing experience with lulu.com</h3>
		<p>Previously I've printed and bound books myself, for example the <a href="GetgoGlasgow.html">GetGo Glasgow book</a>. For this project I tried out lulu's self publishing services as their size was the closest to the original layout 210 x 210 mm. Having sussed the correct bleeding options with lulu customer service's help, convenience, price and speed of the service over-weighs the quality of the colour laser print. Have a look yourself or
