		<h3><em>The 'Tippelzone' was a legalised street prostitution strip in Eindhoven, Netherlands. In 2008 the city council invited a service design group of <a href="#" rel="tooltip" title="Koeln International School of Design">KISD</a> students to create concepts to enable new perspectives for these women to consequently be able to close the Tippelzone in 2011. <a href="http://www.citytv.nl/page/E+/beeldmateriaalE+2/miniconf.pdf">(read the original brief)</a>
		</em></h3>

		<p>Our approach was to initially observe the current practices at the Tippelzone and conduct interviews with the prostitutes, social workers and volunteers supporting the women mentally and physically. This helped us gain an understanding of the issues and perceived shortcomings of the current situation. It became apparent that the <em>existing setting is too rigid, providing no incentives for the prostitutes to undergo detoxification and insufficient cooperation between the supporting social services to help these women holistically</em>. It needed a system approach and a change in attitude of all the stakeholders involved.</p>

		<p>Our design solution is an innovative public service called Levenskracht (Dutch for vitality) which is a collaboration between the different supporting social services. It provides basic and extended support lines to gradually give the prostitutes more responsibility for their own lives through providing intensive support, health services, education and motivation. These service lines are co-created with the women involved. This solution was presented at a conference in Eindhoven in 2008 and a solution inspired by it helped to close the Tippelzone in 2011.</p>

			<h1 class="project__titles">My Role</h1>
			<p>The group was split into three teams. I was part of the first research team send to Eindhoven, I conducted and documented interviews with stakeholders including: politicians, social workers and citizens.</p>
			<p>I documented the findings and passed on contacts to subsequent research teams. I also analysed the current social structure and designed the basic service line touchpoints (below) and was part of the extended project, preparing and structuring the final deliveries including the yearbook and presentation for the conference.</p>

		<h1 class="project__titles span8of8">Learning &amp; Process</h1>
		<div class="span4of8 span4of4">
			<h2>Probe Packs &amp; Research</h2>
			<p>Probe packs were given to prostitutes for the design team to learn about their lives and circumstances.</p>
			<p><em>Learning: Probes do not always work. The packs did not take into consideration short attention spans and did not offer immediate benefit for the women to engage with. Only one of them was returned.</em></p>
			<p>A joined shopping trip with selected prostitutes proofed to be a more effective method of engagement and interview opportunity.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="span4of8 span4of4">
			<h1>Basic service line touchpoints</h1>
			<p>Touchpoints are used to facilitate and communicate a service. In this case the 'personal development book' creates a record of the women's progress of her through detox and gaining work experience. The women have to pass certain milestones which are achieved and certified through working with partnering organisations. <em>It's a framework for change, rather than a solution.</em></p>
