		<p><em>A nine week participatory workshop to document, develop and train young men and women in the Kinnal craft. A pilot project organised by six students from Glasgow in collaboration with the Crafts Council of Karnataka (CCK) based in Bangalore, India.</em>
		</p>

		<p>The objective of the workshop was to train and empower participants, especially the women, with the skill set and understanding of the craft to receive small orders by the CCK post completion of the workshop. Alongside the six Scottish students co-learned with the participants and created new product lines incorporating traditional elements to sell in the Indian urban market as decorations or toys.
		</p>

		<p>The program exceeded our expectations! Not only was a whole new innovative range of products created, but it also received unexpected media interest which led to extended news coverages and even a documentary which was shown internationally. There was a noticeable increase in demand for Kinnal works within India, which tightened the distribution link with the CCK to commission work from the participants after the project supporting it's sustainable development.

			<h1 class="project__titles span8of8">My Role</h1>
			<p>As one of the six members of the student group from Glasgow, I was the driving force challenging the use of Kinnal and innovation. I introduced new ideas, tested different joints and introduced new uses. I also held the position of managing the funds. Post project I was responsible for rounding up the project and providing feedback to the sponsors. I created a majority of the website’s content (which is no longer available) and made video documentaries which communicated the craft’s meaning and process, the workshop’s progression and the experience of integrating into rural India.</p>

			<p>During the course of the workshop we were three times on local and national television and several times in newspapers and magazines. We attracted visitors from as far as Mumbai to meet us. Anand Katti, an Indian documentary maker even produced a documentary about us and the Kinnal project which was shown at international film festivals!</p>

	<blockquote>"When I visited again, I got trailed around the village being over-fed, and shown all the CDs and letters Fee sent them. I always was, and still am, so impressed with her thoroughness. It meant loads to them to get that in the post. The women aren't making much Kinnal, but everyone seems well. I hope they'll let me work with them when I live with them once more, but they seem quite guarded and secretive."</blockquote>
