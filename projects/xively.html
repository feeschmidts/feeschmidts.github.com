			Xively, a division by LogMeIn (NASDAQ: LOGMI), is the first commercial Internet of Things platform which launched May 2013. As a team of two I was responsible for working with stakeholders validating the developer experience and defining and validating the user experience as well as leading a small team - made up of two front-end developers and a visual designer - to produce new features, implement UX improvements and fix QA bugs. I was the main interface between business requirements and translating these into user facing features. Part of that meant translating rather fuzzy requirements into first version wireframes to then in tandem with business stakeholders (often based remotely) and through discussions with the London backend team to agree on the feature set. I coordinated my team's workload and planned sprints using scrum and agile methodologies to ensure lean high quality deliverables.
			I have also been working with several Xively customers who use the platform as means to deliver end user services of a connected product to their users, by providing UX guidance or even full fleshed hi-fidelity wireframes based on insights gathered through workshops with key stakeholders. These applications were designed as web apps or to be used on google glass.

			"Fee has kept a steady pace of improvement, not only in her skills but also in her interactions with her colleagues.
			She surpassed expectations on the Xively rebrand and relaunch, working tirelessly to make sure that the Design team not only met the deadline but also kept a high standard of user experience. Her efforts were fundamental in the process.
			Fee has also introduced more UX methods and techniques into the pipeline, which contributed to the success of the relaunch.
			Fee also demonstrated she is eager to learn and develop new skills outside of UX, such as programming, which broadens her understanding and contribution to the product."
