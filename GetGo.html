		<h1>Getgo Glasgow</h1>
	
		<h3><em>Sustain our Nation (SoN) was a competition for young designers to address the issues of Ageing population, Health, Finance, Crime, Energy and Climate Change, through creating social enterprises using  design thinking</h3></em>
		
	</div>
</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="span4">

			<p>At the Glasgow School of Art three social enterprise concepts were developed in co-creation with the Wyndford estate in Glasgow (classed as the 18th most deprived area in Scotland -BBC), applying a fuzzy front end approach  driven through workshops and engagement tools. Rather than directly addressing an issue and the Sustain Our Nation brief, Getgo Glasgow, a group of twelve students MEDes and MDes Innovation, developed engagement tools and methods to identify real needs and finding a community to work with through winning their trust and enthusiasm.</p>
		</div>

		

		<div class="span4">
			<p>The concept Green Gorillaz won the National Final and secured 20.000 pounds for the Wyndford estate. The social enterprise connects residents by helping them to create interest groups across generations using online and offline platforms. The social enterprise is now being realised supported by GSA design students, Wyndford’s stakeholders and community champions, the so called chiefs, already identified in the co-creation process. See how it's going on the <a href="http://www.getgoglasgow.co.uk/">Getgo Glasgow website</a>.</p>

			<h1>My role</h1>
			<p>The way the project was organised by the design team, I was involved across the whole breath of the  process: from stakeholder interviews to designing engagement tools in the research phase, to writing the business plan, predicting the financial costs and video editing for final deliverable for community, Audi design competition and grading deliverable.</p>

			<p>The task I found most exciting with a great learning outcome were the design of the co-design workshops: the planning and realisation of tasks and working materials, which then were tested first whilst facilitating group tables at the workshops.</p>

			<h1>Designing the Research</h1>
			<blockquote>“How did you find all this out in three weeks? The council still don’t get it!”</blockquote>
			<p class="small">Alice, workshop attendee</p>

			<p>Designing engagement tools and conversation pieces. The large board was a great conversation starter to approach people on the street. The board was also large enough for people to hide behind when capturing what they wrote. To talk to residents of Wyndford a tea and biscuits table rose attention on a cold autumn day, but what really helped to build a trusted relationship was the sign of reciprocity to help them with their football pitch.</p>

			<h1>Codesign Workshops</h1>
			<p>The workshops were great for sharing the research findings and building credibility and trust. The brainstorm games were fun and the presentations highlighted natural leaders whilst ensuring that the design teams actually designed something that members of the community see as useful.</p>
