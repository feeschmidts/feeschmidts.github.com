			<h1>Spotted!</h1>
		
			<p>Spotted! is a nature hunt app for kids and parents to discover bugs and plants of specific areas. It's like geocashing by images. It's super simple: There are five things to discover in a hunt, each hunt is located at a specific area of town, in a street or park. As hunts are solved skills are collected of the creatures that own the hunt - personified plants and animals - representing the kids or adult who created the hunts.</p>

			<blockquote style="margin-top:50px">'Nature Danger' is the fear of parents of their children asking them for names and relevance of plants.</blockquote>

			<p class="small">Spotted! an outcome of #Wildthing by GoodforNothing - a regular Design-led multidisciplinary weekend event. For #Wildthing GoodforNothing collaborated with David Nash - the marketing director of nature - and Green Lions, a film company who is following David on his mission for Channel4. Some ideas developed during #Wildthing were taken forward and prototyped with kids.</p>

			<h1>My Role</h1>
			
			<h3>Research & Insight</h3>
			<p>As part of a group of three + a camera team we split from the big team of 8, and spend the first half a day finding kids and parents to talk to. One mother immediately said when the word 'nature' was mentioned: "I don't know any names of plants or trees" and Tom, an 8 year old who's football birthday party we crashed said, he'd only be outside playing football, but that he liked animals, especially fish when they chase after each other when being fed or eat each other - 'when the wild comes through'.</p>

			<h3>Design and Visual Identity</h3>
			<p>@stef came by the workshop for an afternoon eager to get something working in a limited amount of time. I liked that approach as it required focus and keeping it simple. I helped him set up the first <a href="http://spottedapp.herokuapp.com/games/herb-hunt">herb hunt</a>, created a visual identity, worked on elements of storytelling, tested the existing hack, planned the setup process and did the presentation.</p>

			<h3>Crowd created hunts</h3>
			<p class="small">After downloading the app, each account is associated with a creature as profile. Hunts are crowd created by individuals or organisations with an interest in flora and fauna, then associated with this creature and their special skill. As hunts are solved the special skills of the owners of the hunts are gained. There is no verification mechanism and the hunts will need to go through a <em>moderation system</em>, after all on the first day of the Spotted! hack out, there were already two genital related hunts added.</p>
