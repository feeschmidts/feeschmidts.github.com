        <p style="padding-right:70px">I'm the User Experience Design Lead at <a href="http://xively.com">Xively</a> helping to make the 'Internet of Things' work for humans. I bring together Service Design, User Research and User Centred Design to shape the Xively development experience. I also get to play with code, Arduinos and Raspberry Pi on hackdays and get to meet lots of inspiring makers and entrepreneurs at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/iotlondon/">#IoTLondon meetups</a>.</p>

        <!-- <p>I like to design fun and meaningful new services and tools which allow people to collaborate, learn and create. Most of my work is user centred with a focus on co-creation mainly in social or environmental projects. I would like to gain more experience designing web and native apps in a closely knit team made up of developers and other designers which would ideally also provide an opportunity to deepen my frontend skills with the intention of being able to create interactive prototypes for testing and gaining more insight into UI. I like to get stuck into projects and try to work transparently in an agile manner for better teamwork and progress.</p> -->

        <li><h1>Service Design</h1></li>
        <p>
          Products, print or digital touchpoints are part of a service system. I like to consider every manifestation of the service and stakeholder, their expectation and tasks, and like to design for the memory of the experience when a service or product is being used. For this I visualise research and processes by using a range of methods adapted to their context. These can include Probes, Ethnographic Research Methods, Vision Cards, Personas, Customer Journey Maps, Storyboards, Service Canvases, Flow Diagrams, System Maps, Business Model Canvas, Touchpoint Prototypes, Communication Mockups etc.</p>
        
        <li class="spacer"><h1>Lead CoDesign Processes</h1></li>
        <p>A people-centred process allows iterative and agile development of touchpoints and services, with the additional benefit of attracting early adopters and advocates. I like planning codesign workshops, preparing the tasks to facilitate conversation, brainstorming and storyboarding, and doing user testing and guerilla on qualitative basis.</p>

        <li><h1>User Experience</h1></li>
        <p>I share the view that the user's experience is created from every aspect of the service or business, from hearing about it, packaging, tone of voice, and its products beyond just the digital experience which facilitates the interaction between business and people. Therefore when designing digital touchpoints I think content hierarchy, navigation, copy, visual identity need to be designed in coherence with each other. I'm familiar with specifying User Requirements, Wireframing, User Flows, building Html Prototypes and coordinating with devs, front-end and other designers to detail iterative outcomes.</p>
        <li class="spacer"><h1>Documentation</h1></li>
        <p>I like to think visually and capture process. That's nothing new as a designer, but I literally like to document everything so no insights and reasons for decisions are lost. This can facilitate in drawing diagrams, sketches and thousands of photos with people in them.</p>
