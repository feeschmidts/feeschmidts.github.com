			<p>An Indian energy metering company, called Secure Meters, acquired companies in UK and Sweden. These companies were to be merged under one single company name by 2015. For this the brand transition strategy, the messaging to all stakeholders, the new brand essence and visual identity were to be developed by ONIO NXT.</p>

			<h1>My Role</h1>
			<p>As a design research intern I was 3 months full time on this project working in close collaboration with Manoj Kothari and ONIO’s business specialist. I was involved in all stages of the process: background research: competitor analysis and their messaging, a two week on-sight corporate ethnographic research trip to Europe interviewing employees and local clients; attending client meetings in India and working on the final delivery of the brand transition document and presentation.
			For the ethnographic research with employees I provided European insights of general perception and interest into green living as preparation for the team.  I was solely responsible to develop the research tools acting as communication platforms for current and future brand perception. On the two week research trip, I conducted interviews, transcribed them and extracted it’s key findings. For delivery, I summarised the findings and derived stategies, created all visualisation materials like presentation slides and diagrams as well as mocked up future printed ads and product looks.
