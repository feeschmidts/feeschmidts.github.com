  goal: Designing a seamless development experience for the Internet of Things
  description: |
    Xively, a division by LogMeIn (NASDAQ: LOGMI), is the first commercial Internet of Things platform which launched May 2013.
    For the first year, as a team of two I was responsible for working with stakeholders validating the developer experience and
    defining and validating the user experience as well as leading a small team - made up of two front-end developers and a visual
    designer - to produce new features, implement UX improvements and fix QA bugs. I was the main interface between business
    requirements and translating these into user facing features. Part of that meant translating rather fuzzy requirements into
    first version wireframes to then in tandem with business stakeholders (often based remotely) and through discussions with the
    London backend team to agree on the feature set. I coordinated my team's workload and planned sprints using scrum and agile
    methodologies to ensure lean high quality deliverables.

    I have also been working with several Xively customers who use the platform as means to deliver end user services of a connected
    product to their users, by providing UX guidance or even full fleshed hi-fidelity wireframes based on insights gathered through
    workshops with key stakeholders. These applications were designed as web apps or to be used on google glass.
  achievements: |
    ###Complete Redesign and Rebranding in only four months
    - Restructuring the <em>Web app</em> to make the developer experience more seamless. <em>The marketing pages</em> and its navigation were redesigned from scratch with high focus on narrative flow to be more focused on business. The <em>Developer Center</em> expanded considerably, requiring a scalable structure to ensure an intuitive navigation through resources and api docs.
    - Increasing Page views by 162%</h3><p>On May 14th 2013 Xively launched with a refined Developer Experience and new Developer Resources including tutorials, wrapper libabries and plug-in services. Xively gained great media attention with ten major tech companies featuring Xively. In the first week, views were increased by 162% raising the average visitor rate to 50,000 a week.
    - Doubling daily SignUp Rate Since launch Xively is averaging 70 developer signups per day. <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/08/05/when-it-comes-to-the-internet-of-things-europes-holding-its-own/">(source: GigaOm)
