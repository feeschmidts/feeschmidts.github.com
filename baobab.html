			<h1>Under the Baobab Website</h1>
		
			<h3><em>A website to accompany the Baobab tree revealing stories and inspirations behind the fabrics it's made from.</em></h3>

			<p>The Baobab tree is produced by Pirate Technics, made from fabrics selected or designed by MA textile students from Chelsea Collage of Art and Design. The tree represents the spirit of how the power of art can bring people together and change people's lives. It's a meeting and conversation piece at the heart of the 'Festival of the World' exhibited throughout summer 2012.</p>

			<h1>My role</h1>
			<h3>Website Design & Curation</h3>
			<p>The website was designed to allow visitors to dive into stories and details of patterns by combining sound interviews and photography. The layout resembles that of the baobab tree, the notion of stumbling over an interesting detail which draws you into the tile. It's designed responsibly allowing the layout to adapt to phones of visitors by the tree and to the permanent display within the 'Festival of the World Museum'.</p>

			<p class="small">The website is built in html5 and css3, integrating jquery and javascript elements, such as Soundcloud Strata API, youtube, flickr and fancybox vs2. It's hosted on staticloud.com, source code on <a href="github/feeschmidts">github</a>.

			<h3>Interviews & Sound editing</h3>
			<p>Together with Alex Rinsler, who introduced me to the project, I interviewed the 31 students, the course director and makers of Pirate Technics: What and who is inspiring you to make? What do you associate with your fabric? What do you want visitors to the Festival of the World to learn and feel?</p>
			<p>Post interviews I edited the recordings to 30-60 seconds long sound stories.</p>

			<h3>Photography & Portraits</h3>
			<p>I collected all imagery for the website by taking portraits of all students, photos of their work in progress and sketches and detailed photos of the finished fabrics. For this the fabrics interrupted London's public spaces, reflecting elements of the culture which live inside. These locations included: Trafalgar Square, Thames gardens and beaches, the National Theatre, Southbank, Tate Britain and Waterloo.

			<h3>Displays and information</h3>
			<p>The 'Fabrics of the World website' was exhibited in the museum part of the Festival of the World, ground floor Southbank Centre amongst the background exhibitions of other projects of the festival. I proposed ideas on how the exhibition could be curated, embedding the website as part of the museum experience, reflecting the beauty of the tree outside, but these were not taken forward as I was abroad at crucial times when this exhibition was put together.

			<h3>Automation</h3>
			<p>Curating the work of 31 students and a team of makers was time intensive. It would have been great to design an automated process to summon captions and descriptions for the assets from participants themselves.</p>

			<h3>Exhibition Parental setting</h3>
			<p>As all resources were sourced from external APIs, I was disappointed to see that no one at Southbank Centre tested the site for functionality and correct parental setting. It took several weeks to hunt down the right person to make it functional.</p>

			<h3>Participation & Dynamics</h3>
			<p>The Baobab's concept of a meeting point was not supported by the design of the website or the information displays. A dynamic integration with Instagram would have encouraged people meeting, but would have required moderation and backend.</p>
